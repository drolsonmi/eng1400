## 1.1 	Why Program?

* Hardware: The physical components of which a computer is made.
* Each piece plays a role in the computation process

Main Hardware Components 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* The __Central Processing Unit (CPU)__ is what runs (or executes) the program – this is the most important part of the computer, as this is where the performance of the program happens
* Originally, CPUs were made with “vacuum tubes” that were either pressurized (1) or emptied to a vacuum (0). Today, we use a series of switches
  1.	8 circles filled as (10010101) – this represents the number 149
  2.	8 circles filled as (01001000) – this represents the number 72
  3.	Sending different numbers in sequence accomplished a task. But how does a computer “remember” these numbers? 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)

CPU Organization

Main Memory
* __Main Memory__ is another series of switches (*known as __bits__*), where information is stored temporarily
  * 8 bits is known as a __byte__
  * Also called __Random Access Memory (RAM)__
  * Since this information is temporary, its information is volatile, meaning that inromation is lost when the computer is turned off

Main Memory (2)
* Each piece of information that runs through a CPU is stored into a byte in the RAM
* Assigned an address so that we can reference that byte when it's needed
* Example:
  1. The two numbers are stored in a certain area of the main memory
  2. A third command tells the computer what to do with the first two (addition) – add the two numbers and put in memory cell of first number

Secondary Storage
* Enter the secondary memory or storage,
  a.	Magnetic Tape (Floppy Disks)
  b.	Hard Drive
  c.	USB (Flash) drive
  d.	The Cloud
  e.	Quantum Storage
* This information can be recalled at any time

Main Hardware Components (image)
* __Input devices__ send information to the CPU
* After the CPU performs its job, then its result is sent to some __output device__
