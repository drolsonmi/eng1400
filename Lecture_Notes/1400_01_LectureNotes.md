# 1  Introduction to Computers and Programming
## 1.1 	Why Program?
## 1.2  Computer Systems: Hardware and Software

* Hardware: The physical components of which a computer is made.
* Each piece plays a role in the computation process

Main Hardware Components 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
* The __Central Processing Unit (CPU)__ is what runs (or executes) the program – this is the most important part of the computer, as this is where the performance of the program happens
* Originally, CPUs were made with “vacuum tubes” that were either pressurized (1) or emptied to a vacuum (0). 
  1. 8 circles filled as (10010101) – this represents the number 149
  2. 8 circles filled as (01001000) – this represents the number 72
  3. Sending different numbers in sequence accomplished a task.
* Later, we used a series of switches. Not actual switches (if these switches were moving back and forth billions of time every second, they would heat up and burn out within minutes if not seconds)
* Today, we use electronic switches. Each switch alternates between a positive charge (1) and a negative charge (0) 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
1. The __Control Unit__ is in charge of recieving commands
2. The __Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)__ is in charge of actually performing the task

CPU Organization
* The CPU goes through the *Fetch/Decode/Execute Cycle*
  * *Fetch*: Control Unit obtains the next command
  * *Decode*: Control Unit translates it from 1's and 0's and creates the appropriate electrical signal based on the command
  * *Execute*: The electrical signal triggers the appropriate part of the computer to respond (ALU, disk drive, monitor, other device)

Main Memory
* __Main Memory__ is another series of electronic switches (*known as __bits__*), where information is stored temporarily
  * 8 bits is known as a __byte__
    * 1 byte is what is needed to store one letter (ASCII code)
    * [ascii-code.com](https://www.ascii-code.com)
  * Also called __Random Access Memory (RAM)__
  * Since this information is temporary, its information is volatile, meaning that inromation is lost when the computer is turned off

Main Memory (2)
* Each piece of information that runs through a CPU is stored into a byte in the RAM
* Assigned an address (a unique number assigned to each section of memory) so that we can reference that byte when it's needed
* Example:
  1. The two numbers are stored in a certain area of the main memory
  2. A third command tells the computer what to do with the first two (addition) – add the two numbers and put in memory cell of first number

Secondary Storage
* Enter the secondary memory or storage,
  * Magnetic Tape and Floppy Disks
  * Hard Drive
  * USB (Flash) drive
  * Solid State
  * The Cloud
  * Quantum Storage
* This information can be recalled at any time

Main Hardware Components (image)
* __Input devices__ send information to the CPU
* After the CPU performs its job, then its result is sent to some __output device__
